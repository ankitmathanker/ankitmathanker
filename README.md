# Hi there üëã!! I am ANKIT MATHANKER üßë‚Äçüíª

---

## üéì Summary
I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Chemical Engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering in the University of Michigan. During my Ph.D. I have learned to study various heterogeneous catalysis systems on atomistic level using tools like density functional theory, molecular dyanmics, and machine learning. During my masters I also learned to use autoclave reactor for liquefaction and further product characeterization for biofuels and bitumen upgrading.
